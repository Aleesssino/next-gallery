This project demonstrates the key features of **Next.js 14**, focusing on its powerful app router capabilities. It provides a simple and elegant image showcase that interacts with the Unsplash API to fetch and display images.

## Features

This project highlights several key features of Next.js 14:

- **Static and Dynamic Server-Side Rendering**: Efficiently render pages using static generation and server-side logic.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration**: Automatically update static content without a full rebuild.

- **And More**: Additional features that make building performant and scalable applications easier.

## Unsplash API Integration

The website uses the Unsplash API to fetch and display image content. Please note that Unsplash has a free quota limit of **50 requests per hour**, so you may encounter errors if you exceed this limit.
